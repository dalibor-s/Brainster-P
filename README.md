# BRAINSTER PROJECT – NLP AUTHOR RECOGNITION

## INTRODUCTION
What if one could determine who wrote a piece of text? Reveal the writers behind the texts? Is online review fake and written by spam account? 
Authorship recognition is an important topic in the field of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. It enables us to identify the most likely author of articles, news or messages. Authorship identification can be applied to tasks such as identifying anonymous author, detecting plagiarism or finding ghost writer. 

## DATASET
Dataset contains text from works written by 19th century English language writing authors of the public domain from **[Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)**. With these criteria 7 authors have been selected and their books were queried: **Arthur Conan Doyle**, **Charles Dickens**, **Edgar Allan Poe**, **George Eliot**, **Jack London**, **Jane Austin** and **Mark Twain**. We collected 3 books of each author and built up the data set in csv file. For each book, we selected 10% of the paragraphs. 
The objective is to accurately identify the author of the sentences in the test set. 
We tried two different preprocessing techniques. The first (text_preprocessed) will be fully preprocessed (low letters, missing punctuation, words represented like tokens and then lemmatization. The second dataset (text_preprocessed_1) will only have low letters and will be tokenized.
Dataset was preprocessed using couple of features, relating to the form of the text, and relating to the substance of the text like:
* *Lower casing* - to prevent multiple versions of the same word, all the words despite their casing are normalized to lowercase form so they can all be counted collectively;
* *Separate punctuation from words* – punctuation marks are normalized and removed;
* *Tokenization* – a task of splitting a sentence into pieces, called tokens and removal of unnecessary words at the same time. Each word presents a token;
* *Removing stop-words* – Stop words are generally words that appear commonly at high frequency in a corpus. They don't actually contribute much to the learning or predictive process as a learning model;
* *Lemmatization* –Lemmatization reduce words based on an actual dictionary and therefore will not chop off words into stemmed forms that do not carry any lexical meaning.


## MODELING – extracting test and training data
We approached this project at different levels, with different machine learning models and classifiers, and natural language processing techniques. 
The first approach was using countvectorizer in understanding the type of text by the frequency of words in it. Results showed that better accuracy is seen from Logistic Regression with 82.67%, followed by Random Forest with 78%. But it lacks in identifying more important and less important words, but considers abundant words as the most statistically significant. It also doesn’t identify the relationships between words such as linguistic similarity between them.
For the second approach TF-IDF was used, because it not only focuses on the frequency of words present in the text but also provides the importance of the words. The best result was shown with the Ensemble classifier with accuracy of 88.33%.

## MODEL EXPLAINABILITY
We used the SHAP method to derive a relevance score for each word in an instance. The relevance scores are then aggregated together to achieve global variable importance of the model.

## FINAL MODEL EVALUATION
Among all the trained models the best model has been selected which was TF-IDF ENSEMBLE with accuracy of 88.33%, followed by Logistic Regression with 86.67%.
The results show that the logistic regression algorithm achieved the best result in the first scope compared with the other models, with 82.67% performance accuracy. In all models there is only a slight difference between accuracy and f1 score.

## SUMMARY OF PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED
The first challenge was gathering and preprocessing data, as we decided to make our own dataset.
Also computing time with SHAP was high.

## FUTURE WORK
There are more models that can be applied and then, the accuracy result can be compared to the result achieved in this project. It is possible in future to expand the scope to more authors and books.
This concept can be expanded and improved for Author profiling (characterization)  -  getting the writer’s profile or characteristics; for example, gender, age, background, and language, or Similarity detection for finding the similarity between the texts to determine the possibility of them having been produced by a single writer, without necessarily finding the real author.
